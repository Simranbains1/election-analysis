# Election-Audit Summary
This script can be edited to find additional information regarding this local congressional race. Depending on the needs of the commission and any additional data provided, there is a plethora of data to report. If the commission were to provide a list of voting data in ALL counties in Colorado, we could provide an analysis on the entire state. if population information is provided for each state, we can learn which counties have the highest rates of voting. We could even pull information that lists the lowest-performing counties, and further analysis can be run on potential barriers to voting. Do rural or urban areas have higher turnout? How do counties compare with counties on reservations? Counties with low voter turnout can be further analyzed to find solutions.
